# Abstract-Class
This is a simple Java program that demonstrates the use of inheritance and abstraction. The program models three types of employees: **Baggers**, **Cashiers**, and **Managers**, all of which inherit from an abstract `Associate` class.

## Features
- Defines a base class `Associate` with an abstract method `Call()`.
- Implements specific employee types (`Bagger`, `Cashier`, `Manager`) that extend the `Associate` class and provide unique behavior for the `Call()` method.
- Demonstrates object-oriented principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and method overriding.

## Structure
- **`Associate`**: Abstract class that provides the base structure for all employee types.
- **`Bagger`**: Represents a bagger and implements the `Call()` method.
- **`Cashier`**: Represents a cashier and implements the `Call()` method.
- **`Manager`**: Represents a manager and implements the `Call()` method.
- **`TestMain`**: Main class that creates instances of the above classes and demonstrates their functionality.
